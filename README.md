# Mapping Earthquakes
  Analysis of Earthquakes Data
  
## Overview of the analysis
In this project, we will use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.
After that, we will show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and then all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and we will show the data on a third map.
The following outputs will be produced:

- Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Add Major Earthquake Data
- Add an Additional Map
